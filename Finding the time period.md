# Logic: Finding Time Period with Most Number of Visitors

## Overview
This algorithm processes visitor data collected at a museum to identify the time period during which the museum had the highest number of visitors.

## Input
- `inputFile`: Path to the input file containing visitor data. Each line in the file represents the entering and leaving times of a visitor.

## Output
- `maxPeriod`: Time period with the most number of visitors.
- `maxVisitors`: Number of visitors in the time period.

## Explanation

### Step 1: Read Visitor Data
- Read visitor data from the input file.

### Step 2: Parse Visitor Data
- Parse each line of the input file to extract the entering and leaving times of visitors.

### Step 3: Track Visitor Counts
- Create a dictionary to track the count of visitors at each minute within the visiting period.
- Initialize the count of visitors to zero for each minute.

### Step 4: Process Visitor Data
- For each visitor:
  - Increment the visitor count for each minute between the entering and leaving times.
  - Update the count of visitors in the dictionary for each minute.

### Step 5: Find Maximum Number of Visitors
- Iterate through the dictionary to find the time period with the highest visitor count.
- Keep track of the start and end times of this period.
- Record the maximum number of visitors observed during this period.

### Step 6: Output Result
- Return the time period with the most visitors and the corresponding visitor count.

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity: O(N * M), where N is the number of visitors and M is the average duration of a visit in minutes.
### Space Complexity: O(M), where M is the maximum number of minutes within the visiting period.
